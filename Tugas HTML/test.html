 <p><b>-------- WONDERFUL FAMILY --------</b></p>
 <br>
 <p>I live on a house near the mountains. I have two brothers and one sisters, and I was born
   last. My father teaches mathematics, and my mother is a nurse at a big hospital.
My brothers are very smart and work hard in school. My sister is a nervous girl , but she is very kind. 
My Grandmother also lives with us. She came from Italy when I was two years old. She has grown old, but she still very strong. 
She cooks the best food! </p>
<br>
<p>My family is very important to me. We do lots of things together. My brothers and I like to go on 
   long walks in the mountains. My sister likes to cook with my grandmother. On the weekends we all play board games together. We laugh
   and always have a good time. I love my family very much.

<p><b>-------- A GREAT SUMMER VACATION --------</b></p>
<br>
<p>I just returned from the greatest summer vacation! It was so fantastic, I never wanted it to end.
   I spent eight days in Paris, France. My best friend, Henry and Steve, went with me. We had a beautiful 
   hotel room in the Latin Quarter, and it wasn't even expensive. We  had balcony with a wonderful view.
</p>
<br>
<p>
   We visited many famous tourist places. My favorite was the Louvre, a well-known museum. I was always 
   interested in art, so that was a special treat for me. The museum is so huge, you could spend weeks there. 
   Henry got tired walking around the museum and said <i>"Enough I need to take a break and rest."</i>

</p>
<br>
<p>We took lots of breaks and sat in cafes along the river Seine. The French food we ate was delicious.
   The wines were tasty, too. Steve's favorite part the vacation was the hotel breakfast. Hw said he would be
   happy if he could eat croissants like those forever. We had so much that we're already talking about our next
   vacation!
